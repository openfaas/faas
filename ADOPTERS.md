The Dockerfile template allowed for easy migration of existing code. The latency of transactions for customers during purchase process was reduced by offloading synchronous code to NATS which is built into OpenFaaS. OpenFaaS also allowed "hot path" code to be refactored from large services into multiple functions, to take advantage of horizontal scaling.
