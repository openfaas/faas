OpenFaaS (Functions as a Service) is a framework for building serverless functions with Docker which has first class support for metrics. Any process can be packaged as a function enabling you to consume a range of web events without repetitive boiler-plate coding.

## Highlights

* Ease of use through UI portal and *one-click* install
* Write functions in any language for Linux or Windows and package in Docker/OCI image format
* Portable - runs on existing hardware or public/private cloud - [Kubernetes](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-netes) and Docker Swarm native
* [CLI](http://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli) available with YAML format for templating and defining functions and featuring easy install via curl and brew
* Auto-scales as demand increases
* **New:** Kubernetes support via [FaaS-netes](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-netes) plugin
* **New:** Windows function support
* **New:** Asynchronous/long-running OpenFaaS functions via [NATS Streaming](https://nats.io/documentation/streaming/nats-streaming-intro/) - [Follow this guide](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/guide/asynchronous.md)

## Governance

OpenFaaS is an independent project created by [Alex Ellis](https://www.alexellis.io) which is now being built and shaped by a growing community of contributors. Project website: [openfaas.com](https://www.openfaas.com).
