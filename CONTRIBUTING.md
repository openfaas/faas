# Contributing

Anyone is invited to contribute to the project in-line with the [contribution guide](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Please read the guide for ideas on how to get involved. We also invite new contributors to join our Slack community. We would also ask you to propose any changes or contributions ahead of time, especially when there is no issue or proposal alredy tracking it.

## Guidelines

### How can I get involved?

First of all, we'd love to welcome you into our Slack community where we exchange ideas, ask questions and chat about OpenFaaS, Raspberry Pi and other cloud-native technology. (*See below for how to join*)

We have a number of areas where we can accept contributions:

* Write Golang code for the CLI, Gateway or other providers
* Write for our front-end UI (JS, HTML, CSS)
* Write sample functions in any language
* Review pull requests
* Test out new features or work-in-progress
* Get involved in design reviews and technical proof-of-concepts (PoCs)
* Help us release and package OpenFaaS including the helm chart, compose files, kubectl YAML, marketplaces and stores
* Manage, triage and research Issues and Pull Requests
* Help our growing community feel at home
* Create docs, guides and write blogs
* Speak at meet-ups, conferences or by helping folks with OpenFaaS on Slack

This is just a short list of ideas, if you have other ideas for contributing please make a suggestion.

### I've found a typo

* A Pull Request is not necessary. Raise an [Issue](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/issues) and we'll fix it as soon as we can. 

### I have a [great] idea

The OpenFaaS maintainers would like to make OpenFaaS the best it can be and welcome new contributions that align with the project's goals. Our time is limited so we'd like to make sure we agree on the proposed work before you spend time doing it. Saying "no" is hard which is why we'd rather say "yes" ahead of time.

What makes a good proposal?

* Brief summary including motivation/context
* Any design changes
* Pros + Cons
* Effort required
* Mock-up screenshots or examples of how the CLI would work

### Paperwork for Pull Requests

Please read this whole guide and make sure you agree to our DCO agreement (included below):

* Sign-off your commits 
* Complete the whole template for issues and pull requests
* [Reference addressed issues](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in the PR description & commit messages - use 'Fixes #IssueNo' 
* Always give instructions for testing
* Provide us CLI commands and output or screenshots where you can 

### Unit testing with Golang

Please follow style guide on [this blog post](https://blog.alexellis.io/golang-writing-unit-tests/) from [The Go Programming Language](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440)

### I have a question, a suggestion or need help

Please raise an Issue or email alex@openfaas.com for an invitation to our Slack community.

### I need to add a dependency

We are using the `vndr` tool across all projects. Get [started here](https://github.com/LK4D4/vndr).

### How do I become a maintainer?

Maintainers are well-known contributors who help with:
* Fixing, testing and triaging issues
* Joining contributor meetings and supporting new contributors
* Testing and reviewing pull requests
* Offering other project support and strategical advice

Varying levels of write access are made available via our project bot [Derek](https://github.com/alexellis/derek) to help regular contributors transition to maintainers.

### How do I work with Derek the bot?**

If you have been added to the MAINTAINERS file in the root of an OpenFaaS repository then you can help us manage our community and contributions by issuing comments on Issues and Pull Requests. See [Derek](https://github.com/alexellis/derek) for available commands.

### Governance

OpenFaaS is an independent project created by Alex Ellis which is now being built by a growing community of contributors.

## Community

This project is written in Golang but many of the community contributions so far have been through blogging, speaking engagements, helping to test and drive the backlog of FaaS. If you'd like to help in any way then that would be more than welcome whatever your level of experience.

### Community file

The [community.md](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/community.md) file highlights blogs, talks and code repos with example FaaS functions and usages. Please send a Pull Request if you are doing something cool with FaaS.

### Roadmap

Checkout the [roadmap](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) and [open issues](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/issues).

### Slack

There is an Slack community which you are welcome to join to discuss FaaS, IoT and Raspberry Pi projects. Ping [Alex Ellis](https://github.com/alexellis) with your email address so that an invite can be sent out.

Email: alex@openfaas.com - please send in a one-liner about yourself so we can give you a warm welcome and help you get started.
