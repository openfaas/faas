### Community

This project is written in Golang but many of the community contributions so far have been through blogging, speaking engagements, helping to test and drive the backlog of FaaS. If you'd like to help in any way then that would be more than welcome whatever your level of experience.

#### Community file

The [community.md](https://github.com/alexellis/faas/blob/master/community.md) file highlights blogs, talks and code repos with example FaaS functions and usages. Please send a Pull Request if you are doing something cool with FaaS.

#### Roadmap

Checkout the [roadmap](https://github.com/alexellis/faas/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) and [open issues](https://github.com/alexellis/faas/issues).

#### Slack

There is an invite-only Slack community which you are welcome to join to discuss FaaS, IoT and Raspberry Pi projects. All that is needed is an email address. Get in touch with Alex Ellis.

#### Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for a patch. Your
signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass
it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify
the below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):

```
