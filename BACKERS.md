# OpenFaaS Project Backers

OpenFaaS is licensed as MIT and completely Open Source and free to use. However the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features is not sustainable without proper financial backing.

Companies using OpenFaaS with their products or projects are encouraged to join at Gold or Platinum tier. Commercial support is also available.
