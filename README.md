## Overview of OpenFaaS (Serverless Functions Made Simple)

![Conceptual architecture](/docs/of-layer-overview.png)

### Press / Branding / Website Sponsorship

* Individual Sponsorships / End-users / Insiders Track üçª

  OpenFaaS is free to use and completely open source under the MIT license, however financial backing is required to sustain the effort to maintain and develop the project.
  
  Users and contributors are encouraged to join their peers in supporting the work through [GitHub Sponsors](https://insiders.openfaas.io/), all tiers gain exclusive access to the [Insiders Track](BACKERS.md)

* Website Sponsorship üåé

  Companies and brands are welcome to sponsor [openfaas.com](https://www.openfaas.com/), the Gold and Platinum tiers come with a homepage logo, [see costs and tiers](BACKERS.md). Website sponsorships can be paid by invoice to OpenFaaS Ltd.

* Press / Branding üì∏

  For information on branding, the press-kit, registered entities and sponsorship head over to the [openfaas/media](https://github.com/openfaas/media/blob/master/README.md) repo. You can also order custom SWAG or take part in the weekly Twitter contest [#FaaSFriday](https://twitter.com/search?q=faasfriday&src=typd)

  Looking for statistics? This project does not use a mono-repo, but is split across several components. Use [Ken Fukuyama's dashboard](https://kenfdev.o6s.io/github-stats-page) to gather accurate counts on contributors, stars and forks across the [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/openfaas).

  > Note: Incubator projects are not counted in these totals and are hosted under [openfaas-incubator](https://github.com/openfaas-incubator) awaiting graduation.

### Governance

OpenFaaS&reg; is an independent project founded by [Alex Ellis](https://www.alexellis.io) which is now being built and shaped by a growing community of contributors, GitHub Organisation members, Core contributors and end-users. OpenFaaS Ltd hosts the OpenFaaS codebase and trademarks. Professional services, sponsorships, and commercial support packages are available [upon request](mailto:sales@openfaas.com).

### Users

If you're using OpenFaaS please let us know [on this thread](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/issues/776). In addition, you are welcome to request to have your logo listed on the homepage. Thank you for your support.

### Technical overview

#### Function Watchdog

* You can make any Docker image into a serverless function by adding the *Function Watchdog* (a tiny Golang HTTP server)
* The *Function Watchdog* is the entrypoint allowing HTTP requests to be forwarded to the target process via STDIN or HTTP. The response is sent back to the caller by writing to STDOUT or HTTP from your application.

#### API Gateway / UI Portal

* The API Gateway provides an external route into your functions and collects Cloud Native metrics through Prometheus.
* Your API Gateway will scale functions according to demand by altering the service replica count in the Docker Swarm or Kubernetes API.
* A UI is baked in allowing you to invoke functions in your browser and create new ones as needed.

> The API Gateway is a RESTful micro-service and you can view the [Swagger docs here](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/tree/master/api-docs).

#### CLI

Using the [faas-cli](http://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli) and `faas-cli up` you can create, build, distribute, and deploy your code in a very short period of time.

Any container or process in a Docker container can be a serverless workload in OpenFaaS, as long as it [conforms to The Workload Contract](https://docs.openfaas.com/reference/workloads/).

Create new functions from templates for Node.js, Python, [Go](https://blog.alexellis.io/serverless-golang-with-openfaas/) and many more. If you can't find a suitable template you can also use a Dockerfile or create your own.

The CLI is effectively a RESTful client for the API Gateway. When you have OpenFaaS configured you can [get started with the CLI here](https://blog.alexellis.io/quickstart-openfaas-cli/)

#### Examples

You can generate new functions using the `faas-cli` and built-in templates or use any binary for Windows or Linux in a Docker container.

Official templates exist for many popular languages and are easily extensible with Dockerfiles.

* Node.js (`node12`) example:

    ```js
   "use strict"
   
    module.exports = async (event, context) => {
        return context
            .status(200)
            .headers({"Content-Type": "text/html"})
            .succeed(`
            <h1>
                üëã Hello World üåç
            </h1>`);
    }
 
    ```
    *handler.js*

* Python 3 example:

    ```python
    import requests

    def handle(req):
        r =  requests.get(req, timeout = 1)
        return "{} => {:d}".format(req, r.status_code)
    ```
    *handler.py*

* Golang example (`golang-http`)

    ```golang
    package function

    import (
        "log"

        "github.com/openfaas-incubator/go-function-sdk"
    )

    func Handle(req handler.Request) (handler.Response, error) {
        var err error

        return handler.Response{
            Body: []byte("Try us out today!"),
            Header: map[string][]string{
                "X-Served-By": []string{"openfaas.com"},
            },
        }, err
    }
    ```

### Roadmap and contributing

OpenFaaS is written in Golang and is MIT licensed - contributions are welcomed whether that means providing feedback, testing existing and new feature or hacking on the source.

#### How do I become a contributor?

Please see the guide on [community & contributing](https://docs.openfaas.com/community/#contribute)

#### Roadmap

The roadmap for OpenFaaS is represented in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/issues) and [a Trello board](https://trello.com/b/5OpMyrBP/2020-openfaas-roadmap).

##### Roadmap: OpenFaaS Cloud

[OpenFaaS Cloud](https://github.com/openfaas/openfaas-cloud) is a platform built on top of the OpenFaaS framework which enables a multi-user experience driven by GitOps. It can be installed wherever you already have OpenFaaS and packages a dashboard along with CI/CD integration with GitHub so that you can push code to a private or public Git repo and get live HTTPS endpoints.

#### Dashboards
