## Functions As A Service (faas)

FaaS is a platform for building serverless functions on Docker Swarm Mode with first class metrics. Any UNIX process can be packaged as a function in FaaS enabling you to consume a range of web events without repetitive boiler-plate coding.

## Concept

* Each container has a watchdog process that hosts a web server allowing a JSON post request to be forwarded to a desired process via STDIN. The response is sent to the caller via STDOUT.
* A gateway provides a view to the containers/functions to the public Internet and collects metrics for Prometheus and will manage replicas and auto-scale as throughput increases.

## Minimum requirements: 
* Docker 1.13 (to support attachable overlay networks)
* At least a single host in Swarm Mode. (run `docker swarm init`)

## TestDrive

You can test-drive FaaS with a set of sample functions as defined in docker-compose.yml on play-with-docker.com for free, or on your own laptop.

**Highlights:**

* Ease of use through UI portal
* Setup a working environment with one script
* Portable - runs on any hardware

* Baked-in Prometheus metrics
* Any container can be a function
* Auto-scales as demand increases

#### Prometheus metrics are built-in

Prometheus is built into FaaS and the sample stack, so you can check throughput for each function individually with a rate function in the UI at port 9090 on your Swarm manager.

If you are new to Prometheus, you can start learning about metrics and monitoring on my blog:
