OpenFaaS&reg; makes it easy for developers to deploy event-driven functions and microservices to Kubernetes without repetitive, boiler-plate coding. Package your code or an existing binary in an OCI-compatible image to get a highly scalable endpoint with auto-scaling and metrics.

## Overview of OpenFaaS (Serverless Functions Made Simple)

![Conceptual architecture](/docs/of-layer-overview.png)

> Conceptual architecture and stack, [more detail available in the docs](https://docs.openfaas.com/architecture/stack/)

### Code samples

You can generate new functions using the `faas-cli` and built-in templates or use any binary for Windows or Linux in a container.

Official templates exist for many popular languages and are easily extensible with Dockerfiles.

* Node.js (`node12`) example:

    ```js
   "use strict"

    module.exports = async (event, context) => {
        return context
            .status(200)
            .headers({"Content-Type": "text/html"})
            .succeed(`
            <h1>
                üëã Hello World üåç
            </h1>`);
    }

    ```
    *handler.js*

* Python 3 example:

    ```python
    import requests

    def handle(req):
        r =  requests.get(req, timeout = 1)
        return "{} => {:d}".format(req, r.status_code)
    ```
    *handler.py*

* Golang example (`golang-http`)

    ```golang
    package function

    import (
        "fmt"
        "net/http"

        handler "github.com/openfaas/templates-sdk/go-http"
    )

    // Handle a function invocation
    func Handle(req handler.Request) (handler.Response, error) {
        var err error

        message := fmt.Sprintf("Body: %s", string(req.Body))

        return handler.Response{
            Body:       []byte(message),
            StatusCode: http.StatusOK,
        }, err
    }
    ```

### Official eBook and video workshop
[![eBook logo](https://www.alexellis.io/serverless.png)](https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else)

The founder of OpenFaaS wrote *Serverless For Everyone Else* to help developers understand the use-case for functions through practical hands-on exercises using JavaScript and Node.js. No programming experience is required to try the exercises.

The examples use the faasd project, which is an easy to use and lightweight way to start learning about OpenFaaS and functions.
