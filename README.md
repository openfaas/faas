## Functions as a Service (FaaS)

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexellis/faas.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexellis/faas)

FaaS is a framework for building serverless functions with Docker which has first class support for metrics. Any process can be packaged as a function enabling you to consume a range of web events without repetitive boiler-plate coding.

**Highlights**

* Ease of use through UI portal and *one-click* install
* CLI available with YAML format for templating and defining functions
* Write functions in any language for Linux or Windows and package in Docker/OCI image format
* Portable - runs on existing hardware or public/private cloud
* Auto-scales as demand increases

## Overview of FaaS

### Function Watchdog

* You can make any Docker image into a serverless function by adding the *Function Watchdog* (a tiny Golang HTTP server)
* The *Function Watchdog* is the entrypoint allowing HTTP requests to be forwarded to the target process via STDIN. The response is sent back to the caller by writing to STDOUT from your application.

### Gateway 

* The API Gateway provides an external route into your functions and collects Cloud Native metrics through Prometheus. 
* Your API Gateway will scale functions according to demand by altering the service replica count in Docker's Swarm API.
* A UI is baked in allowing you to invoke functions in your browser and create new ones as needed.

### CLI

Any container or process in a Docker container can be a serverless function in FaaS. Using the FaaS CLI you can deploy your functions or quickly create new functions from templates such as Node.js or Python.

Let's have a quick look at an example function `url_ping` which connects to a remote web server and returns the HTTP code from the response. It's written in Python.

```
import requests

def handle(req):
        r =  requests.get(req, timeout = 1)
        print(req +" => " + str(r.status_code))
```
*handler.py*

```
$ curl -sSL cli.get-faas.com | sudo sh
```

*Install the faas-cliÂ which is also available on `brew`*

Define your functions in YAML - or deploy via the API Gateway's UI.

```
provider:
  name: faas
  gateway: http://localhost:8080

functions:
  url_ping:
    lang: python
    handler: ./sample/url_ping
    image: alexellis2/faas-urlping
```

*Example function YAML file - `urlping.yaml`*

```
$ faas-cli -action build -f ./urlping.yaml
```
*Build a Docker image using the Python handler in `./sample/url_ping`*

```
$ faas-cli -action deploy -f ./urlping.yaml
```
*Deploy the new image to the gateway defined in the YAML file.*

> If your gateway is remote or part of a multi-host Swarm - you can also use the CLI to push your image to a remote registry or the Hub with `faas-cli -action push`

```
$ curl -d "https://cli.get-faas.com" http://localhost:8080/function/url_ping/
https://cli.get-faas.com => 200
```

*Test out the function with the URL https://cli.get-faas.com => 200*

[Sample functions](https://github.com/alexellis/faas/tree/master/sample-functions) are available in the Github repository in a range of programming languages.

## Get started with FaaS 

### Closing Keynote at Dockercon 2017

Functions as a Service or FaaS was a winner in the Cool Hacks contest for Dockercon 2017.

* [Watch my FaaS keynote at Dockercon 2017](https://blog.docker.com/2017/04/dockercon-2017-mobys-cool-hack-sessions/)

If you'd like to find the functions I used in the demos head over to the [faas-dockercon](https://github.com/alexellis/faas-dockercon/) repository.

**Background story**

This is my original blog post on FaaS from Janurary: [Functions as a Service blog post](http://blog.alexellis.io/functions-as-a-service/)

### TestDrive

A one-line script is provided to help you get started quickly. You can test-drive FaaS with a set of sample functions as defined in the provided [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/alexellis/faas/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file. 

Use your own laptop or the free community-run Docker playground: play-with-docker.com.

> This doesn't work since it won't clone the Prometheus and AlertManager config.

## Roadmap and contributing

FaaS is written in Golang and is MIT licensed - contributions are welcomed whether that means providing feedback, testing existing and new feature or hacking on the source. To get started you can checkout the [roadmap and contribution guide](https://github.com/alexellis/faas/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) or [browse the open issues on Github](https://github.com/alexellis/faas/issues).

Highlights:

* New: FaaS CLI and easy install via `curl` and `brew`
* New: Windows function support
* Planned: Kubernetes support
* Planned: Asynchronous FaaS functions via NATS Streaming
