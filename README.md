OpenFaaS&reg; makes it easy for developers to deploy event-driven functions and microservices to Kubernetes without repetitive, boiler-plate coding. Package your code or an existing binary in a Docker image to get a highly scalable endpoint with auto-scaling and metrics.

### Code samples

You can generate new functions using the `faas-cli` and built-in templates or use any binary for Windows or Linux in a Docker container.

Official templates exist for many popular languages and are easily extensible with Dockerfiles.

* Node.js (`node12`) example:

    ```js
   "use strict"
   
    module.exports = async (event, context) => {
        return context
            .status(200)
            .headers({"Content-Type": "text/html"})
            .succeed(`
            <h1>
                üëã Hello World üåç
            </h1>`);
    }
 
    ```
    *handler.js*

* Python 3 example:

    ```python
    import requests

    def handle(req):
        r =  requests.get(req, timeout = 1)
        return "{} => {:d}".format(req, r.status_code)
    ```
    *handler.py*

* Golang example (`golang-http`)

    ```golang
    package function

    import (
        "log"

        "github.com/openfaas-incubator/go-function-sdk"
    )

    func Handle(req handler.Request) (handler.Response, error) {
        var err error

        return handler.Response{
            Body: []byte("Try us out today!"),
            Header: map[string][]string{
                "X-Served-By": []string{"openfaas.com"},
            },
        }, err
    }
    ```

### Roadmap and contributing

OpenFaaS is written in Golang and is MIT licensed - contributions are welcomed whether that means providing feedback, testing existing and new feature or hacking on the source.

#### How do I become a contributor?

Please see the guide on [community & contributing](https://docs.openfaas.com/community/#contribute)

#### Roadmap

The roadmap for OpenFaaS is represented in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/issues) and [a Trello board](https://trello.com/b/5OpMyrBP/2020-openfaas-roadmap).

##### Roadmap: OpenFaaS Cloud

[OpenFaaS Cloud](https://github.com/openfaas/openfaas-cloud) is a platform built on top of the OpenFaaS framework which enables a multi-user experience driven by GitOps. It can be installed wherever you already have OpenFaaS and packages a dashboard along with CI/CD integration with GitHub so that you can push code to a private or public Git repo and get live HTTPS endpoints.

#### Dashboards
