OpenFaaS (Functions as a Service) is a framework for building serverless functions with Docker and Kubernetes which has first class support for metrics. Any process can be packaged as a function enabling you to consume a range of web events without repetitive boiler-plate coding.

**Highlights**

* Ease of use through UI portal and *one-click* install
* Write functions in any language for Linux or Windows and package in Docker/OCI image format
* Portable - runs on existing hardware or public/private cloud - [Kubernetes](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-netes) and Docker Swarm native
* [CLI](http://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli) available with YAML format for templating and defining functions
* Auto-scales as demand increases

### Function Watchdog

* You can make any Docker image into a serverless function by adding the *Function Watchdog* (a tiny Golang HTTP server)
* The *Function Watchdog* is the entrypoint allowing HTTP requests to be forwarded to the target process via STDIN. The response is sent back to the caller by writing to STDOUT from your application.

### API Gateway / UI Portal

* The API Gateway provides an external route into your functions and collects Cloud Native metrics through Prometheus.
* Your API Gateway will scale functions according to demand by altering the service replica count in the Docker Swarm or Kubernetes API.
* A UI is baked in allowing you to invoke functions in your browser and create new ones as needed.

> The API Gateway is a RESTful micro-service and you can view the [Swagger docs here](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/tree/master/api-docs).

### CLI

Any container or process in a Docker container can be a serverless function in FaaS. Using the [FaaS CLI](http://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli) you can deploy your functions quickly.

Create new functions from templates for Node.js, Python, [Go](https://blog.alexellis.io/serverless-golang-with-openfaas/) and many more. If you can't find a suitable template you can also use a Dockerfile.

> The CLI is effectively a RESTful client for the API Gateway.

When you have OpenFaaS configured you can [get started with the CLI here](https://blog.alexellis.io/quickstart-openfaas-cli/)

### Function examples

You can generate new functions using the FaaS-CLI and built-in templates or use any binary for Windows or Linux in a Docker container.

* Python example:

```python
import requests

def handle(req):
    r =  requests.get(req, timeout = 1)
    print(req +" => " + str(r.status_code))
```
*handler.py*

* Node.js example:

```js
"use strict"

module.exports = (callback, context) => {
    callback(null, {"message": "You said: " + context})
}
```
*handler.js*

Other [Sample functions](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/tree/master/sample-functions) are available in the Github repository in a range of programming languages.

## Documentation

We are building a new documentation site at [docs.openfaas.com](http://docs.openfaas.com). 
The source repository for the documentation website is [openfaas/docs](https://github.com/openfaas/docs).

For all other guides, tutorials, trouble-shooting and blog posts head over to our [guides page](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/tree/master/guide) on GitHub.

## Get started with OpenFaaS

### Hands-on labs (detailed getting started)

You can learn how to build functions with OpenFaaS using our hands-on labs in the [OpenFaaS workshop](http://github.com/openfaas/workshop).

### TestDrive (classic getting started)

**Kubernetes**

OpenFaaS is Kubernetes-native - you can follow the [deployment guide here](http://docs.openfaas.com/deployment/kubernetes/).

**Docker Swarm**

The deployment guide for Docker Swarm contains a simple one-line command to get you up and running in around 60 seconds. It also includes a set of [sample functions](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/tree/master/sample-functions) which you can use with the TestDrive instructions below.

[Deployment guide for Docker Swarm](http://docs.openfaas.com/deployment/docker-swarm/)

The new login feature breaks the one-click deployment to PWD.
**Docker Playground**

You can quickly start OpenFaaS on Docker Swarm online using the community-run Docker playground: play-with-docker.com (PWD) by clicking the button below:
