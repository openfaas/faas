  - name: test
    value: |
           This project follows a contributing guide which requires that
           all changes are tested before being merged. You should include
           worked examples that a maintainer can run to prove that the
           changes are good.

           Screenshots and command line output are also accepted, but
           must show the positive, and negative cases, not just that 
           what was added worked as you expected.

           Thank you for your contribution.
