# React Portal

This is the beginning of a the rewrite of the portal to react.

Please be aware that is just the bare-bones at this moment as i wanted feedback before spending more time on it.

Wanted to use the new version of react therefore all components can be functional based components and there wont be a need for class based components.
I went for typescript because type safety is a bit nicer in platforms. The typing isn't to strict as is, but we can increase if need be.
